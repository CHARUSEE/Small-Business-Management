# Small-Business-Management
Small Business Management  The definition of a small business is an independently owned and operated company that is limited in size and in revenue depending on the industry.  Like an example of a local bakery that employs 10 people.  Small businesses are those which are not known to many people and are opened on any social media. People making things and working from home, this actually came to people’s knowledge since during pandemic lot of people lost their jobs. These small businesses are mostly coming to not only existing but also in people’s eye through all the social media platform which was our only way to communicate with other people during pandemic.
